# Automated merge: version1 (base) + version2 (added)

This merge was performed automatically with conservative heuristics.

## What was done

- Version1 (edusync-java-main 2.zip) was used as the base project.
- Files from version2 (student1-main.zip) were copied into the merged tree when they did not conflict.
- Files from version2 that would have overwritten existing version1 files were placed under `v2_features/`.
- Files that appeared to involve authentication/login logic were NOT used to overwrite v1 files and were placed under `v2_features/` to avoid changing the login behavior.

## Where to look

- Merged project root: this directory.
- Version2 additions and conflicting files: `v2_features/` (preserves v2 relative paths).

## Conflicts and skipped overwrites (partial list)

- Number of v2 files copied directly into merged tree: 33
- Number of v2 files placed into v2_features due to path conflict: 0
- Number of v2 files placed into v2_features due to auth-safety heuristic: 0

## Recommended manual steps

1. Review files in `v2_features/` and integrate controller/service/entity code into the base project packages.
2. Apply the provided SQL migration (see `db_migration.sql`) to add `student_uploads` table.
3. Implement any wiring in your DI framework (e.g. Spring) to register new services and repositories.
4. Run unit & integration tests and perform manual QA (login flow, uploads, faculty visibility).
